// Given the equation BMI = Weight/(Height * Height) we are asked to calculate the BMI based on inputs
// This takes two inputs and pops them into int and reg registers. Using the reg register as a 'working' 
// register so that we can preserve the first value (which is the weight) within the int register we 
// proceed to walk through the equation above and arrive at our solution. 

int = input;
reg = input;
reg = reg * reg;
reg = int/reg;
output = reg;
