// This will take the input value (which is guarenteed to be negative) and set the int register to the inverse.
// This works because of the simple mathematical principle that anything multiplied by -1 will be the inverse. 
// eg. 4 * -1 = -4 or -4 * -1 = 4 ktl.

int = input * -1;
output = int;
